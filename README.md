The home page warmly welcomes users, offering an overview of the site's purpose. It serves as an entry point, setting the tone for the user's journey on the platform.

### Articles
<a name="articles"></a>

The articles page hosts a collection of articles covering various topics. These articles are not only informative but also include valuable advice to help users improve their lives in different aspects.

### Tests

The quizzes page (currently in development) will feature interactive quizzes aimed at engaging users in a fun and informative way.

### Ideas
<a name="ideas"></a>

The ideas page presents users with a set of idea cards. These ideas are randomly generated from a list and can be managed using three buttons: delete (permanently removes the idea), postpone, and add to personal idea list. Some ideas come with additional features, including thematic articles that delve deeper into the concept and offer guidance on how to realize it.

### Photo Gallery

The photo gallery is a special space where users can share their photos along with captions and descriptions. Users can upload their images, create photo reports, and share their impressions and experiences. Photos can be liked, expanded for a closer view, and organized based on user-generated content.

### User Profile
<a name="user-profile"></a>

The user profile page is a personalized hub for users. They can customize their profiles by adding avatars, updating their names, birthdates, and inspirational quotes. The profile also includes:

#### Sketchpad
<a name="user-sketchpad"></a>

A section equipped with a drawing tool, allowing users to take notes or doodle freely.

#### Calendar
<a name="user-calendar"></a>

Users can input their birthdate to generate a special table that displays their lived years, months, weeks, and days. Empty cells represent the remaining time. Note that the calculations might deviate from real-time by approximately Â±5 days.

## Future Plans
